## Image

Official image (example):

  docker pull adarcher/archer-fitness:latest

Replace `adarcher/archer-fitness:latest` with the tag you need.

## Quickstart ‚Äî run with Docker

1. Create an `.env` file (see Environment variables below).
2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name archer-fitness \
  --env-file .env \
  -p ${PORT:-3000}:${PORT:-3000} \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  adarcher/archer-fitness:latest
```

The web app will be available on http://localhost:${PORT:-3000}

Notes:
- The container expects the database to be reachable from inside the container via `DATABASE_URL`.
- For production, use a networked PostgreSQL (or a managed DB) rather than a local socket.

## Quickstart ‚Äî Docker Compose

Example `docker-compose.yml` snippet (minimal):

```yaml
services:
  archer-fitness:
    image: adarcher/archer-fitness:latest
    container_name: archer-fitness
    ports:
      - "${PORT:-3000}:${PORT:-3000}"
    env_file:
      - .env
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - PORT=${PORT:-3000}
      # Uncomment below if using the local db service
      # DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/archer_fitness?schema=public
    restart: unless-stopped
    # depends_on:
    #   - db  # Uncomment if using the local db service
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "wget", "--no-verbose", "--tries=1", "--spider", "http://localhost:${PORT:-3000}/api/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 40s

  # --- OPTIONAL: Local PostgreSQL Database ---
  # Uncomment to run a local db for dev/testing
  # db:
  #   image: postgres:15
  #   container_name: archer-fitness-db
  #   restart: unless-stopped
  #   environment:
  #     POSTGRES_DB: archer_fitness
  #     POSTGRES_USER: postgres
  #     POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
  #   ports:
  #     - "5432:5432"
  #   volumes:
  #     - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  db-data: {}
```

After creating `.env` and the compose file:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Notes on ports vs healthchecks:

- The Docker `HEALTHCHECK` runs inside the container and queries `localhost` within the
  container network namespace ‚Äî it does NOT require publishing/mapping the port to the host.
- `EXPOSE` and publishing (`ports:`) only affect host accessibility; they are not required for
  an internal healthcheck to work.
- If you want to reach the app from your host machine (browser), you still need to publish a port
  with `ports: - "${PORT:-3000}:${PORT:-3000}"` (or set `-p` with `docker run`).

Example: publish port to host (optional):

```yaml
  web:
    ports:
      - "${PORT:-3000}:${PORT:-3000}"
```

## Environment variables

At a minimum, set:

- DATABASE_URL ‚Äî PostgreSQL connection string (e.g. postgresql://user:pass@db:5432/archer_fitness?schema=public)
- NEXTAUTH_SECRET ‚Äî secret for NextAuth
- NEXTAUTH_URL ‚Äî public URL (e.g. https://example.com or http://localhost:3000)
- NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY ‚Äî VAPID public key for push notifications
- VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY ‚Äî VAPID private key for push notifications
- VAPID_EMAIL ‚Äî contact email for VAPID
- ADMIN_EMAIL ‚Äî admin email for error and startup notifications (optional)
- GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID ‚Äî Google OAuth client ID (optional)
- GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET ‚Äî Google OAuth client secret (optional)
- NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID ‚Äî Google OAuth client ID for client-side detection (optional)

### Generate VAPID Keys

Before running the container, generate VAPID keys for push notifications:

Go to [https://vapidkeys.com/] or 

```bash
# Clone the repository to access the script
git clone https://github.com/ad-archer/archer-fitness.git
cd archer-fitness

# Generate VAPID keys
node scripts/generate-vapid-keys.js
```

Copy the generated keys into your `.env` file.

**Note:** Push notifications require valid VAPID keys to work. Without them, the notification feature will not function properly.

Example `.env`:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/archer_fitness?schema=public"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-super-secret-key"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY="your-generated-public-key"
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY="your-generated-private-key"
VAPID_EMAIL="admin@yourdomain.com"
ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@yourdomain.com"
# Optional: PORT is read by Docker Compose when using dotenv. Set if you want a custom port.
PORT=3000
```

## Google OAuth Setup (Optional)

If you want to enable Google sign-in for your users:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google+ API
4. Go to "Credentials" in the left sidebar
5. Click "Create Credentials" ‚Üí "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
6. Configure the OAuth consent screen if prompted
7. Set the application type to "Web application"
8. Add authorized redirect URIs:
   - For development: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
   - For production: `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback/google`
9. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret to your `.env` file

**Note:** If Google OAuth is not configured, users will see a warning message on the sign-in and sign-up pages, but can still use email/password authentication with optional 2FA.

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Archer Fitness includes built-in two-factor authentication support:

- **TOTP-based**: Compatible with Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator, 1Password, Bitwarden, and other authenticator apps
- **Backup Codes**: 10 single-use recovery codes generated during setup
- **User Control**: Users can enable/disable 2FA from their security settings
- **Secure Storage**: 2FA secrets are stored securely in the database

### Setting up 2FA (for end users):

1. Sign in to your Archer Fitness account
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Security
3. Click "Enable 2FA"
4. Scan the QR code with your authenticator app
5. Save the backup codes in a secure location
6. Enter the verification code to activate 2FA

Once enabled, users will need to enter a 6-digit code from their authenticator app (or a backup code) after entering their password during sign-in.

## Generate VAPID Keys
```

## Build locally (optional)

If you want to build the image locally:

```bash
# from repo root
docker build -t archer-fitness:local .
```

Then run with the `arche-fitness:local` tag as above.

## Health and persistence

- Database is external to the web image and should be backed up and persisted via Docker volumes or external DB service.
- Use `--restart unless-stopped` for resilience.

## Ports

- ${PORT:-3000} ‚Äî Next.js application port (mapped to host in examples)

## Volumes

This image does not require persistent storage for the app itself (stateless). Persist the database with a named volume or external service.

## Security & best practices

- Do not store secrets in images. Use `--env-file` or your orchestration secrets manager.
- Run the app behind a reverse proxy (nginx, Traefik) with TLS in production.
- Use a managed database or ensure your PostgreSQL is secured and backed up.
- Enable 2FA for admin accounts for enhanced security.
- Regularly backup your database to preserve user data and 2FA settings.
- Use strong `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` values (at least 32 characters).
- Keep VAPID keys secure and never commit them to version control.

## Troubleshooting

- **502 / cannot connect**: Check `DATABASE_URL` and network configuration between the container and the database.
- **500 errors on auth**: Verify `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and `NEXTAUTH_URL` are correct.
- **Push notifications not working**: Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` and `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` are set correctly.
- **2FA QR code not displaying**: Check browser console for errors and ensure the app can generate QR codes.
- **Google OAuth fails**: Verify redirect URIs in Google Cloud Console match your `NEXTAUTH_URL`.

View logs:

```bash
docker logs -f archer-fitness
```

## Database Migrations

The application automatically runs Prisma migrations on startup. If you need to manually run migrations:

```bash
docker exec -it archer-fitness npx prisma migrate deploy
```

To view the database schema:

```bash
docker exec -it archer-fitness npx prisma studio
```
